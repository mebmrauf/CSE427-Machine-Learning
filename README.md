## Course Objective
The objective of this course is to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of fundamental and advanced machine learning concepts, techniques, and algorithms. Students will learn how to build, train, and evaluate various machine learning models for both classification and regression tasks. The course emphasizes practical implementation and theoretical understanding of decision trees, ensemble methods, and optimization algorithms. Additionally, it introduces neural networks, deep learning architectures, and modern approaches to natural language processing. By the end of the course, students will be able to:

- Understand and apply core machine learning algorithms such as decision trees, random forests, and boosting methods.
- Implement supervised learning models including Naive Bayes, logistic regression, and gradient-based optimization.
- Design and train neural network models, including convolutional and recurrent architectures.
- Understand parameter update mechanisms with activation functions such as ReLU and softmax.
- Apply deep learning techniques like LSTM and transformers for sequence modeling and language translation tasks.
